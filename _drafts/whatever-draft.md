Some Draft Content

**_drafts**: Draft blog posts can be kept here. They are posts you're still working on, which won't be displayed on the live site until they are moved to the `_posts` directory and given a date in the filename.

* command: jekyll serve --draft
* But I think this method is really unnecessay, you can just put a future date and view it directly with command "Jekyll serve" , and when you think its good, just change the data and post it.

### Another way: You can include a line in your YAML Front Matter to indicate whether a post is published or not: published: true or published: false
