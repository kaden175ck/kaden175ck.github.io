I always wondered what YAML files were. As a programmer, I've seen them frequently, and after some research, I finally understand them. Programmers don't usually write YAML directly, but it's incredibly useful to know how they work so you can understand your configuration files.

**What is YAML?**

* **Human-friendly Data:** YAML (originally Yet Another Markup Language, but now stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language) is designed to be a data serialization language that's exceptionally easy for humans to read and write.
* **Configuration Files and More:** It's frequently used for configuration files, but its capabilities go beyond that. YAML can represent complex data structures, making it suitable for various data-related tasks.

**Key Features**

* **Readability:** YAML's core strength is its readability. It emphasizes a clean syntax that avoids excessive punctuation and symbols.
* **Indentation-Based Structure:** Unlike JSON or XML, YAML uses **indentation** (**SPACE**, **NOT TABS**) to define the structure of data. This makes it visually intuitive.
* **Superset of JSON:**  If you know JSON, you already understand a good chunk of YAML.
* **Data Types:** YAML supports common data types:
    * Scalars (strings, numbers, booleans)
    * Lists (sequences, similar to arrays) 
    * Dictionaries (key-value pairs, also called maps or hashes)

*Note*: `.yml` and `.yaml` mean the same thing. Comments are made using `#`. 

**Example**

Here's a simple example of a YAML configuration file that demonstrates common YAML features:

```yaml
person:
  name: "Mike"
  occupation: 'Programmer'
  age: 23
  fav_num: 1e+10 # Exponential number
  male: true # Boolean value
  birthday: 2001-12-25 # ISO 8601 date format

  hobbies:
    - Hiking
    - Movies

  movie: 
    - "Source Code"
    - "" # An empty element in the list

  friends:
    - name: "Steph"
      age: 22

# Description and signature with specific formatting directives
description: > # Treats everything within as a single line 
  This is a single-line text despite the breaks, demonstrating YAML's flexibility in handling text blocks.
signature: | # Preserves the formatting 
  Gmail
  Name
  School

# Advanced structures with anchors and aliases
person_alias: &person
  name: "Mike"
  occupation: "Programmer"
friends_list:
  - <<: *person
    age: 22
    relationship: "Colleague"

# Data type enforcement
age: !!float 23 # Interpreted as 23.0
gpa: !!str 3.5 # Interpreted as a string "3.5"

``` 

**Example from My Blog, you see this _config.yml in my repo:**

```yaml
title: Rand Tech Blog
description: >-  
  I document things.
