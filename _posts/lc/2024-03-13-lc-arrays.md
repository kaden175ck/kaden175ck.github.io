_**In this post, I'll explore common array-based LeetCode questions, covering easy and medium difficulty levels.**_

**Problem1: Two Sum**
* **Problem Description:** Given an array of integers and a target value, determine if there are two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Return the indices of the two numbers.

* **Example:**
  * Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
  * Output: [0, 1] (Because 2 + 7 = 9)


* **There are many ways to solve this question, but for the sake of practicing arrays, we will include array-based solutions, which may not be the most optimized.**

<tr>
<td>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def two_sum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
    return None
</code></pre>
<p>
This method will be more straightforward but less efficient than using a dictionary. It involves using two loops to check every pair of numbers in the array to see if they add up to the target. 3/13

<pre><code class="language-python">
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_dict = {}
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        needed = target - num
        if needed in num_dict:
            return [num_dict[needed], index]
        num_dict[num] = index
    return None
</code></pre>
<p>
In Python, a dictionary is a type of hash table that can map keys to values. For this problem, we can use a dictionary to remember the numbers we've seen in the array as well as their indices. We'll use this to store the array numbers as keys and their indices as values. 3/13

**Problem2: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

* **Problem Description:** You have an array where each element represents the price of a given stock on a single day.  Find the maximum profit you can achieve by making a single transaction (buying once and selling once).

* **Example:**
  * Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
  * Output: 5 (Buy on day 2 when the price is 1, sell on day 5 when the price is 6)

**Problem3: Contains Duplicate**

* **Problem Description:** Determine if a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements.

* **Example:**
  * Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
  * Output: true

**Problem4: Single Number**

* **Problem Description:** In an array where every number appears twice except for one, find the single number.

* **Example:**
  * Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
  * Output: 4

**Problem5: Product of Array Except Self**

* **Problem Description:** Given an array of integers, calculate an output array where each element is the product of all the other elements in the input array *without* using division. 

* **Example:** 
  * Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  * Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]

**Problem6: 3Sum**

* **Problem Description:** Find all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.

* **Example:**
  * Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
  * Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

**Problem7: Spiral Matrix**

* **Problem Description:** Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

* **Example:**
  * Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
  * Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

**Problem8: Container With Most Water**

* **Problem Description:** You are given an array representing heights of walls. Calculate the maximum amount of water that can be contained between any two walls, assuming they form a container.

* **Example:**
  * Input: heights = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
  * Output: 49
