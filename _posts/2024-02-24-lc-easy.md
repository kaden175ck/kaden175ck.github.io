**Problem1: Two Sum**

Given an array of integers (`nums`) and an integer (`target`), return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the `target`.

**Example:**

```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
Output: [0, 1]  // Because 2 + 7 = 9
```

**Constraints**

* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
* You may not use the same element twice.

**My thoughts**

* 1: Brute force it, for i in num, we use i+(i+1) to match the target, if unmatch then move on to check i+1+(i+1+1)...until target match.
* 2: loop the array, then target - num = complement, we check if complment is seen in the dictionary, if seen we get the current array index and the index of the seen dictionary. As we loop through the array, we store each number as a key in the hashmap and its index as the value.For each number, we calculate the complement needed to reach the target. Then we simply check if that complement already exists as a key in our hashmap. If it does, we've found our pair!

**Smart way**

Python:
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # Create an empty hashmap (dictionary)

    for index, num in enumerate(nums):  # enumerates assgin pairs, turns your nums list into pairs 
    # like this:(0, 2)  index 0, value 2 ; (1, 7) index 1, value 7
                                                 
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:  # The complement is found...
            return [seen[complement], index]  //get the 2 index
            //If the complement is already present as a key(key in hashmap is like words, like real stuff, in this case is the number itself) in the seen hashmap, it means its found. Return the index of the current number(index) and the stored index(stored value in hashmap seen[complement]). remember the stored value its the index

        seen[num] = index  # store the current num as a key and its index as the value in our seen dictionary

    return None  # This means no solution was found

why this work:
By storing numbers as keys, we can quickly check if the complement we need has already been seen during our loop.

**Brute Froce Way**

def two_sum_brute_force(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):  # Start inner loop from next index
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]

    return None  # No solution found

**Space Complexity**

Brute Force Time Complexity: O(n^2). We have nested loops, each going through potentially all elements.

Hashmap Approach Time Complexity: O(n). On average, we loop through the array once, and hashmap operations are fast.

**Problem2: Palindrome Number**

Determine if an integer is a palindrome, where it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example:**

* Input: 121  
  Output: true

* Input: -121 
  Output: false (negative numbers are not palindromes)

* Input: 10
  Output: false

**Constraints**

You shouldn't convert the integer into a string to solve this problem. Think about how you can work with the number itself mathematically.


**My thoughts**
Using % rio get the last digit , and division // by 10 to shift the digt, build a rever one and compare it with the original

**Python Smart Solution**
def is_palindrome(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False

    original_num = x  # original number x
    reversed_num = 0  # Initialize the reversed number 
    // extract digits and build reversed_num
    while x > 0:  # Loop as long as the number is positive
        last_digit = x % 10  # Extract the last digit
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + last_digit // shhifting the previous number to the left(*10)
        x = x // 10  # Remove the last digit from the original number 

    # Handle potential middle digit in reversed_num
    if original_num // 10 == reversed_num // 10:  //removes the middle digit if the original has odd len
        return True
    else:
        return False

**Python no Opt Solution**
previous solustion include an optimization where we only need to reverse about half of the digits to determine if a number is a palindrome.
Reseaon why Opt works: 
Odd number of digits: The middle digit doesn't affect if it's a palindrome (e.g., in '12321', the '3' doesn't matter).
Even number of digits: All digits must fully match when reversed.


// not Opt veriosn
fully reversed number first and then compare it to the original:
def is_palindrome(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False

    original_num = x
    reversed_num = 0

    while x > 0: 
        last_digit = x % 10
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + last_digit
        x = x // 10    // its same as Opt version untill here
        //The loop continues until the entire number is reversed.

    # Comparison after building the complete reversed number
    return original_num == reversed_num

Fantastic! Here's another easy-level problem that involves a slightly different kind of thinking:

**Problem: Roman to Integer**

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

|Symbol| Value|
|---|---|
|I|1|
|V|5|
|X|10|
|L|50|
|C|100|
|D|500|
|M|1000|

They are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII, but rather IV. The six subtractive combinations are:

* IV (5 - 1 = 4)
* IX (10 - 1 = 9)
* XL (50 - 10 = 40)
* XC (100 - 10 = 90)
* CD (500 - 100 = 400)
* CM (1000 - 100 = 900)

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Example**

* Input: "III"
  Output: 3

* Input: "LVIII"
  Output: 58 (L = 50, V= 5, III = 3)

* Input: "MCMXCIV"
  Output: 1994 (M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4)

**Considerations**

* Think about how you would read and process the Roman numeral string.
* Can you detect and handle the special subtractive cases?

**Let me know if you'd like a hint or are ready to start trying a solution!**
