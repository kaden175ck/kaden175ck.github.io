Betweenness Centrality: This measures how important an edge is in connecting different parts of the network. High betweenness edges are our prime targets!

Degree: Imagine a group of people, and each person is a "node" in a network. The degree of a node is the number of friends that person has. So, a node with a high degree means that person is connected to many other people in the group.
Density: Imagine a small group of friends, where everyone knows each other. That's a dense network. But if you have a large group where people only know a few others, that's a less dense network. Network density measures how connected the nodes are compared to how many connections they could potentially have.
Centrality measures: In a network, some nodes are more important than others. Centrality measures help identify the most important nodes. There are different ways to measure centrality, like:

a. Degree centrality: This is similar to the degree we talked about earlier. The more connections a node has, the more central it is.

b. Closeness centrality: This measures how close a node is to other nodes. Nodes with high closeness centrality are closer to all other nodes in the network.

c. Betweenness centrality: This measures how often a node is on the shortest path between other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness centrality act as bridges between different parts of the network.

These concepts are useful for understanding how networks work and how information or influence spreads within them.
